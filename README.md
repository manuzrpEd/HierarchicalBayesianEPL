The notebook predicts English Premier League (EPL) match outcomes using hierarchical Bayesian modeling techniques. 

- Forecast match outcomes (win, draw, loss) using historical EPL data.
- Model team dynamics, home-field advantage, and goal statistics.
- Compare model assumptions on prediction accuracy.

The project utilizes data from 1993 to 2024 and employs advanced Bayesian methods for prediction accuracy.

- Variables: home and away goals, match outcomes, and team identities.
- Source: [football-data.co.uk](https://www.football-data.co.uk/).
- Seasons before 1995/96 should have 462 matches if complete.
- Seasons from 1995/96 onwards should have 380 matches.


The analysis focuses on goal statistics and does not incorporate additional factors such as player-level details or weather conditions.
